Renaming the Persian Gulf and Shipping Immigrants to Libya 
May 7, 2025
By Connie Willis
Trump’s deporting of immigrants leaped back into the news today:
--This week Trump announced that they were going to pay immigrants to leave the country. Trump: "What we thought we would do is self-deport. (Oh, God, if only that were true.) We’re gonna pay each one a certain amount of money and we’re gonna get them a beautiful flight back to where they came from." But apparently that didn’t work because now the Trump administration is back to sending secret flights full of immigrants to prisons in other countries, the latest one being Libya, even though they’ve been told by two separate federal judges now that they cannot do that.
--Trump is using a military aircraft for the flight, and lawyers for the immigrants are scrambling to get a hold put on the flight before it leaves. Human rights groups have called the migrant detention centers in Libya "horrific and deplorable." The State Department cautions US citizens from traveling to Libya "due to crime, terrorism, unexploded land mines, civil unrest, and armed conflict."
--Meanwhile a declassified intelligence memo that was obtained through FOIA contradicts the key claim Trump made to invoke the Alien Enemies act, which was that Venezuela was directing the gang Tren de Agua to invade the US. The memo says Venezuela did no such thing.
--Also, a hacker got hold of the flight information from the El Salvador flights and published it. The information shows that the last flight, which the Trump administration said only had criminal gang members subject to the Alien Enemies Act on it, had no such thing. They were just people with a final order of removal.
Trump continues to tout his tariffs in ways that show he has no idea AT ALL how tariffs work:
--Trump: "We don’t have to sign deals. We could sign 25 deals right now...if we wanted. We don’t have to sign deals. They have to sign deals with us. They want a piece of our market. We don’t want a piece of their market."
--Trump, talking about trade with China: "By not trading, we’re losing nothing, so we’re saving a trillion dollars. That’s a lot." And "They want to meet, and they’re doing no business right now, and their ships are turning around in the Pacific Ocean--big turn. Those are big ships. Those ships take about ten miles to turn." He also claimed China is "suffering greatly."
--Scott Bessent said today that the US will begin trade negotiations with China on Saturday and that Peter Navarro will not be involved. When asked if those negotiations were advanced, he replied, "I said, on Saturday we will begin, which I believe is the opposite of advanced."
--China warned Washington against using talks as "a smoke screen to continued coercion and extortion."
--When asked which countries the US will sign a trade deal this week, Bessent refused to tell the reporters: "It’s a secret."
--And then there was this exchange between Bessent and Democratic Representative Donald Meeks: Meeks: "Do trade deficits constitute a national emergency?" Bessent: "Yes." Meeks: "Do you know that for the last 4 decades we have had trade deficits and nobody said it was a national emergency?"
--Then, hours after Bessent left the door open to lowering tariffs on China, Trump said he’s not open to pulling back tariffs on China.
--Fed chairman Jerome Powell held interest rates steady, though he warned of rising risks to the economy, citing the uncertainty surrounding US trade policy and the economic implications and saying, "if the large increases in tariffs that have been announced are sustained, they are likely to generate a rise in inflation, a slowdown in economic growth, and an increase in employment."
--Trump said he would have 90 deals in 90 days. We are now 24 days in, and still not a single deal.
--The Atlantic: "The stock market goes up and down. Maritime indicators keep on sinking."
For some reason, the whole,"Girls should only have two dolls" thing has really taken hold:
--Trump: "I don’t think that a beautiful baby girl--that’s eleven years old--needs to have 30 dolls. I think they can have three or four dolls. He later expanded his comment: "All I’m saying is that a young lady, a 10-year-old girl, a 9-year-old girl, a 15-year-old girl doesn’t need 37 dolls," and saying kids didn’t need to have 250 pencils either, they could make do with five. And then, when reporters continued to press, he said, "Let’s not waste a lot of time on stupid questions."
--Part of the problem is that his saying that was a tacit admission that his tariffs will cause shortages and raise prices. Another is that Fox has spent YEARS telling their viewers that Americans have the right to buy anything they want--gas stoves, cars, washers, shower heads, light bulbs, plastic straws--and that anyone who tries to restrict those purchases is some kind of communist. Fox: "You can’t mandate what people buy." Laura Ingraham: "Communism leads to shortages and fewer options in the marketplace." The very same things Trump is talking about now.
--Yet another is that his kids obviously had every toy in the world--the picture of toddler Barron with his GOLDEN baby carriage, his life-sized stuffed tiger, and his toy Mercedes-Benz is all over the internet right now."
--GOP Representative David Joyce: "I think the American people will understand that because the American people understand shared sacrifice."
--When Mike Johnson was asked about Trump’s opining, he said, "We had to disrupt the system and we’re going to have the desired results."
--Bill Kristol: "So last night on Fox, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent decided to leap to his boss’s defense and explain what HE would say to a disappointed doll-deprived girl: ‘I would tell that young girl that you will have a better life now thanks to President Trump.’ Good luck to parents who try this! Meanwhile, Democrats will continue to point out that Trump and his fellow billionaires seem perfectly comfortable having working- and middle-class families while the rich get their tax cuts and they make their crypto fortunes."
--Republican Senators are telling Trump to stop talking about dolls. A Senate aide: "Telling people they’ll get less and pay more doesn’t strike me as a winning message."
--Jon Stewart: "If a Democrat had even hinted at toy rationing for American children, we’d have a full week of Fox Special Reports on the sobbing children of socialist Americans and a boom in gun-toting patriots going, "You can have my GI Joe when you pry it from my kung fu grip."
--Supply chain guru Ryan Peterson: "If they don’t change the tariffs, it’s going to be an extinction-level, asteroid-destroying-the-dinosaurs kind of event" wiping out thousands of businesses and millions of jobs. Dolls and pencils will be the least of our worries."
--And the Nation may have hit on something else that creeped everybody out about the whole doll thing: "Nobody wants to hear the serial sexual abuser and friend of the late predator Jeffrey Epstein talk about "a beautiful baby girl--that’s eleven years old,"-- or a ten-year-old girl, a 10-year-old girl, a 15-year-old girl--"as though he’s reminiscing about his time on Epstein’s notorious island."
In Pete Hegseth Destroys the Pentagon news:
--Pete Hegseth ordered the Pentagon to cut the number of 4-star generals and admirals by 20%, saying, "Less generals, more GI’s." The generals to be fired are the ones with the highest ranks and the most experience.
--Denise Marshall: "Wonder if Hegseth is trying to stave off a military revolt by getting rid of those whose loyalty is to the Constitution?"
--Democratic Senator Jack Reed: "Secretary Hegseth has shown an eagerness to dismiss military leaders without cause, and I will be skeptical of the rationale for these plans until he explains them before the Armed Services Committee."
--Hegseth (in full TV makeup) said: "We are leaving wokeness behind. No more pronouns, no more climate change obsessions, no more emergency vaccine mandates, no more dudes in dresses. We are done with that shit."
--They lost another fighter jet off the same aircraft carrier as last week. They said the reason for losing it was "unclear."
--Michelle L. Price, on Trump’s changing the name of the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Arabia: "I’m more concerned about our fighter jets at the bottom of the Red Sea."
--Emptywheel: "Waiting for Trump to announce the US will order Google Maps to start calling the Red Sea the F/A-18 Graveyard."
In JD Vance news:
--At a task force meeting on 2026’s World Cup, JD Vance told soccer fans: "We will have visitors probably from close to a hundred countries. We want them to come, we want them to celebrate, we want them to watch the games. But when the time is up, they’ll have to go home, otherwise they’ll have to talk to Secretary Noem." (Who’ll ship them off to Libya. And shoot their dog.)
--Surprise, surprise, his remarks lit up social media. The Wall Street Journal said, "Quite a way to motivate foreign tourists," and Luke Lodge from the UK tweeted, "Honestly, just watch it from the safety of your couch, folks."
--Keith Olbermann: "Relax on Vance’s insane threat to jail international World Cup ticket holders if they don’t leave the country immediately rather than stay here and spend tourism money. Watch. FIFA will be moving the World Cup elsewhere."
--This isn’t the first time sending JD Vance someplace resulted in a catastrophe. He went to Ohio State and broke their championship trophy. He went to Italy to meet the pope, and the pope died. He went to India, and India now seems to be at war with Pakistan. You gotta stop sending him places. Or else send him to Russia to talk to Putin.
--JD Vance endorsed his brother in a race for mayor. His brother lost 83% to 11% in the primary.
In other news:
--Secretary of Education Linda McMahon sent Harvard a letter threatening to cancel all their federal funding. Harvard corrected all the mistakes in spelling, punctuation, and grammar in it with red pen and sent it back to her, then posted the whole thing online. The best part: The letter said, "This is like hiring the captain of the Titanic to teach navigation to future captains of the sea." Red pencil: "Check Titanic history." (Note: In case you don’t know what they’re referring to, Captain Smith went down with the Titanic when it sank.)
--India fired missiles into Pakistan. Both countries have nukes. Trump had no comment. He was too busy announcing he is changing the name of the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Arabia. (No, I am not making this up.
--The Wall Street Journal is reporting that Trump told the DOJ to send the CIA to spy on Greenland to investigate the degree of opposition to his invading. (This is both illegal and a violation of the NATO agreement.)
In good news:
--A federal judge halted Trump’s attempt to eliminate the Institute of Museum and Library Services.
--ICE tried to raid the Chang Chang restaurant in DC, but the mayor ran them off. He told them they needed a warrant. The agents said they didn’t need a warrant and tried to push past the staff to get at the kitchen workers. The staff didn’t budge, and the ICE agents eventually left.
--Scientific societies have announced that they will complete the climate studies which were shut down by the Trump administration.
--20 State Attorneys are suing Trump and Health and Human Services to restore the health agencies that Musk and DOGE cut.
--Bristol Myers Squibb shareholders voted to reject two anti-DEI proposals.
In great news:
--Barack Obama’s daughter, Malia, directed an ad for Nike called "One of a Kind," which is both a shoe ad and a paen to black female athletes--and black little girls. It’s great! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpVEoYjmZps
Funniest comment of the day, from Governor J.D. Pritzker, on hearing that Kristi Noem will be coming to Springfield: "We would urge all pet owners in the region to make sure all of your beloved animals are under watchful protection while the secretary is in the region."
Best comment of the day, from Michael O’Brien: "Throwing yourself a $92 million dollar military parade while cutting health care resources for veterans has to be a golden ticket straight to the darkest depths of hell, right?"
And the best thing ever: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBaHPND2QJg (It will make your day. I promise.)
