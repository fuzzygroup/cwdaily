The big news today was Trump in the Middle East doing his best to debase himself:
--He’s in Saudi Arabia for starters, where he saluted every single Saudi general, even though American Presidents are not supposed to salute any foreign dignitary.
--JoeyFotoFr: "As an American citizen, my President salutes no one in the world...saluting these guys is a national humiliation by the traitor Trump, a pig POTUS."
--Republicans Against Trump: "Trump salutes a Saudi general. Disgusting, disgraceful. So much for ‘America First...why does Trump keep saluting generals from autocratic regimes?" (He saluted North Korea’s generals, too.)
--Artie Vandelay decried Trump’s saluting the generals "while standing next to the guy who had a resident American journalist beheaded and dismembered for writing things he didn’t like. All seems on point." (Exactly. You just know Trump wishes he was able to do the same thing.)
--Then he gave an hour-long, meandering speech, the greater part of which was lavishing praise on Mohammed bin Salman, the very man responsible for that slaughtering and dismembering of an American journalist. Trump: "We have great partners in the world, but we have none stronger and nobody like the gentleman right before me. He’s your greatest representative. And if I didn’t like him, I’d get out of here so fast. He knows me well. I do. I like him a lot. I like him too much." (Disgraceful. Disgusting.)
--As if he couldn’t go any lower, he then announced we were NOT going to demand that Saudi Arabia sign the Abraham Accords and he announced a multi-billion dollar deal with the Saudis.
--He also announced he was taking all sanctions off Syria AND was adding a side trip to Syria to meet with their leaders before he heads to Qatar--after they dangled a Trump Tower Damascus in front of him. (I’m sure that part is just a coincidence.)
--Oh, and don’t forget, Qatar was who bailed out Ivanka’s husband, Jared Kushner, on the 666 Fifth Avenue deal.
--Mahmoun Fancy, Director of London Global Strategy: "Trump politics is all personal. He showered the Saudi Crown Prince with praise...Trump is basically yelling, We are not part of western democracy anymore!"
--Mehdi Hassan: "The man who wanted to ban all Muslims from entering the US because of terrorism is meeting this week with the former head of Al Qaeda in Syria.
--No wire services, including AP and Reuters, were allowed to accompany Trump on this trip, but he somehow found room for all the usual suspects--Pete Hegseth, Howard Lutnick, Susie Wiles, Marco Rubio, Stephen Miller, Dan Scavino, Steven Cheung, Karoline Leavitt, Sean Hannity, and, of course, Elon Musk--to go with him.
--Musk expressed his love for Mohammed bin Salman, too: "I really believe we like each other a lot."
All of these bizarre activities follow yesterday’s Trump announcements of tariff deals, drug controls, and flying palaces from Middle Eastern emirs, and the remarkable thing about them is the fact that in announcing them he sounded even more batshit crazy than usual:
--Sarah K. Burrio of Raw Story called his press conference an "off-script hour-long diatribe."
--Travis Matthews: "Advanced dementia on full display."
--Trump: "Mattel. They’re the only country I’ve heard saying they're going to go someplace else. That’s okay. Let them go and we’ll put a 100% tariff on his toys. He can’t sell one toy in the US."
--Reporter: "Do you support Israel’s plan to conquer Gaza?" Trump: "These are very strange questions. I never like when they read them off machines. Who is sending in a question to you? Let’s not talk about that now." (Translation: I have no idea what you’re talking about.)
--Trump claimed he saved Obamacare: "I made it work. I could have let it die, but I chose to make it work." (A blatant lie. What happened was that he tried repeatedly to kill it during his first term and was finally defeated by that famous thumbs-down vote by John McCain, who he has never forgiven.)
--Trump, about the Qatari plane he’s accepting as a gift: "They are giving us a free jet. I can say no, no, no, don’t give us--I want to pay you a bill--again or 400 million or whatever it is, or I can say thank you. You know, there was an old golfer named Sam Snead. Did you ever hear of him? He won 82 tournaments, he was a great golfer. He had a motto, ‘When they give you a putt, you say thank you very much. You pick it up and walk to the next hold. A lot of people are stupid, they say, no, no, I insist on putting it. They they putt it, they miss it. Then their partners get mad at them."
--Also: "I would never be one to turn down that kind of an offer. I could be a stupid person and say I don’t want a free plane." When a reporter asked him about it, he snapped at him, "It’s not, is not a gift to me. It’s a gift to the Department of Defense and you should know better. Cause you have embarrassed enough, and so has your network. Your network is a disaster, ABC is a disaster." (ABC is who broke the story about the plane, which was supposed to be secret.)
--He talked about the tariff deal with China, sort of: "We made a great deal, China, but it was a much bigger deal but they canceled it at the last moment...People thought it was 15 because they were doing 15. we made it 50 because I misunderstood the 15...and I thought he said 50. So I said--so they came back with the deal at 15 and I said no way, I want 50 because you said 50. They said, sir, we didn’t say that. Anyway, bottom line I said go back and ask for 50 and they gave us 50...then they canceled it the last day and I got a little bit angry." (Not sure what he’s talking about since neither figure ended up in the deal. (Some people think he was talking about a deal made with China in his first term because at one point he mentioned Sonny Perdue, who was his Secretary of Agriculture in Trump’s first term.)
--He told a story that started out being about the cost of drugs: "A friend of mine who’s a businessman--very, very, very top guy. Most of you would have heard of him. Highly neurotic, brilliant businessman. Seriously overweight. And he takes the fat, the fat shot drug. And he called me up and he said, ‘President,’ he calls me--he used to call me Donald. Now he calls me President. So that’s nice. Respect. But he’s a tough guy. Smart guy. Very successful, very rich." (Everyone, including the late-night comedians, immediately concluded that the highly neurotic and seriously overweight guy he was talking about was Elon Musk.)
--He then told a long, rambling story about how this very neurotic, seriously overweight guy was shocked to find that the fat drug cost less in London than the US, so Trump personally negotiated with the drug companies to bring down prices and brought them to their knees within half an hour.
--Trump: "It is not price control. What was price control was before."
--Once again Trump wandered off without signing the executive order he’d been touting. Hugo Nogo: "The brain of a ‘genius’ in sad decline." Timothy Bellman: "Sleepy Don has no clue what’s going on."
--dwegman: "Is Donald Trump mentally stable?...This is not normal. This is not how Presidents communicate with the public. We...as a nation...must stop accepting this insane, hyper-partisan rambling with legitimate communication with the White House."
--dpsNaz: "We’re watching a person struck by a destructive combination of severe mental illness and fast-progressing dementia."
Trump also made dozens of all-caps, crazy-sounding posts:
--Trump: "Happy Mother’s Day to all, including Racist, Vicious, Highly Partisan, Politically Motivated, and Very Unfair Radical Left Democrat Judges, Prosecutors, District Attorneys, and Attorney Generals, who campaign unrelentingly against you without knowing a thing, and endlessly promise to take you down. After years of persecution, even the Fake News says there is no case or, it would be very hard to bring. Someday soon they will start fighting RECORD SETTING Violent Crime. I love you all!!!"
--Trump: "IN JUST THREE MONTHS, TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS (AND THEREFORE RECORD NUMBERS OF JOBS!) HAVE BEEN POURING INTO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THIS IS BECAUSE OF MY TARIFF POLICY."
--Trump: "So the fact that the Defense Department is getting a GIFT, FREE OF CHARGE of a 747 aircraft to replace the 40-year-old Air Force One, temporarily, in a very public and transparent transaction so bothers the Crooked Dems that they insist we pay TOP DOLLAR for the plane. Anybody can do that! The Dems are WORLD CLASS LOSERS!!!"
--And in other disturbing news, Trump has attended only 12 national security briefings since elected (he’s supposed to attend them twice a week) and has not been directly involved in any trade deals.
--He’s also reportedly complaining to guests at Mar-a-lago that things are not going as well as he thought they would and that the job of being president is really, really hard/ He’s specially upset that he hasn’t been able to end the war in Ukraine and is starting to think Putin might be "stringing him along."
The plane thing continues to dog Trump:
--Alan Marcus: "(The plane)’s just another way of showing off who has the most power."
--Trump lackey Sebastian Gorka got furious when he was asked by the BBC about the plane: "Do you ever have pangs of conscience that you are so utterly and completely biased that all you can do is give in to your Trump Derangement Syndrome?" He added, "I like it when a head of state saves the taxpayer $400 million dollars." (The problem is that more and more experts are weighing in to tell the taxpayer just how much the refit of the plane for security and communications, to say nothing of the planes Boeing is already working on, is going to cost him. Some say it’s in the billions.)
--Dem Rep Ritchie Torres is calling for an investigation into the gift of a Qatari aircraft to Trump and an immediate ethics review.
--And even elected Republicans continue to speak out. Rand Paul said he wouldn’t take it, and GOP Rep Dusty Johnson said, "I don’t like it. There’s a reason that people can’t even buy me a steak dinner. It’s not necessary that you can prove I have an ethical problem, it’s that the appearance of it doesn’t look great."
--Trump’s defenders continue to cover for him, too. Ryan Zinke said, "Remember who "President Trump is. He’s a billionaire businessman from New York. He doesn’t sleep in a sleeping bag overnight. He says, ‘Hey, this is a great plane.’" (Translation: It’s okay because he’s rich and deserves whatever he wants.)
--Sundae Gurl: "He (Zinke) served under Trump, left under 15 separate investigations, and still wasn’t the most corrupt guy in the first Trump administration.")
--Seth Meyers had the perfect comparison for Trump being able to keep the plane after he leaves office: "It’s like if after Grover Cleveland was President, he got to take the Statue of Liberty and put it in his backyard."
--MAGA continues to be really upset over this. Jamie: "This 400 million dollar plane from Qatar...is setting things up for Trump to go extra soft on these barbarians."
--MAGA Emily Lida: "The Trojan horse. Lots of business happens on that jet so of course they will arm it with bombs or sound pieces or even the controls as we know aircraft are crashing for no reason."
--Cartoon seen today: "Your captain has turned on the ‘Accepting bribes from foreign governments’ sign."
In tariffs news:
--Trump, in his speech in Saudi Arabia: "Now we’re tariffing them. And...uhhhhhh...it’s at a level nobody has seen."
--Wall Street Journal: "Rarely has an economic policy been repudiated as soundly, and as quickly, as President Trump’s Liberation Day tariffs--and by Trump’s own hand." They said it was Trump’s "second major retreat in less than a week," and "a win for economic reality."
--Rightwinger Charles Gasparino: "BREAKING: Trump raised tariffs on the world, and the markets, particularly the bond market--which we need to finance our debt--rebelled. Trump was then forced to back off. End of story."
--Ron Filipkowski: "China agreed to reduce the tariffs they raised in response to Trump's tariffs after Trump agreed to lower his tariffs. Create a problem, surrender, then declare victory."
--Also Ron Filipkowski: "Trump reaches a ‘deal’ to pause the tariffs he imposed on China. I guess all those manufacturing jobs aren’t coming here now, the tariffs won’t replace income taxes, and all the other amazing things they were supposed to do for us are over. So much for Liberation Day."
--And in FAFo news regarding the tariffs, on 7-1-24 Austin Peterson posted: "I’m voting for Donald Trump for the economy. And to own the libs." On 5-8-25, he posted: "Well, there went my shoe business. I don’t understand why the tariffs have to eliminate the de minimus exception. Why does government punish small businesses...knowing full well that Nike and all the big brands will be fine paying the taxes but Steffi and I get wiped out."
In Kennedy Center news:
--Rick Grenell is apoplectic because a bunch of the cast members of LES MIS are refusing to appear onstage the night Trump attends: "Any performer who isn’t professional enough to perform for patrons of all backgrounds, regardless of political affiliation, won’t be welcomed. In fact, we think it would be important to out these vapid and intolerant artists to ensure producers know who they should and shouldn’t hire--and that the public knows which shows have political litmus tests to sit in the audience."
--What Grenell didn’t mention was that Trump’s appearance at LES MIS was a two million dollar fundraiser.
--Lin-Manuel Miranda: "The Kennedy Center was not created in this spirit and we’re not going to be part of it while it is the Trump Kennedy Center."
--Slate: "From what I could tell, it (the Kennedy Center) was flourishing. It had money, and it was doing what it was supposed to be doing pre-Trump...the Trump anti-Midas touch is in operation here, and now everything is worse. Not only are ticket sales down, but donations have been paused, artists are pulling out. All of the spigots for money have slowed down or have been turned off."
--They’ve been talking about bringing back good, old-fashioned, Trump-approved musicals to the Kennedy Center, but I’m not sure where they’re going to find any. SOUTH PACIFIC ("You have to be carefully taught to hate" and inter-racial marriage) andPORGY AND BESS and FLOWER DRUM SONG are obviously out. LES MIS is about an uprising of the poor against the cruelties of the rich, THE MUSIC MAN glorifies librarians and "dirty books," THE SOUND OF MUSIC is about people bravely fighting the Nazis, THE PAJAMA GAME is about unions fighting management, GIGI’s about a prostitute, and FINIAN’S RAINBOW is about integration and how evil racism is. I guess it’s going to be an endless re-running of CATS. (The word is the staff used to play him songs from CATS to calm him down when he got "particularly nasty" during his first term.)
--Oh, and they could perform LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS, but only if Trump doesn’t figure out he’s Audrey Two.
In other news:
--Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered all military leaders and commands to pull all library books that address diversity, anti-racism, or gender issues, by May 21.
--Trump has tapped DOJ deputy Todd Blanche as the acting head of the Library of Congress, which is unconstitutional. You can’t name an executive branch official to head a legislative branch agency.
--Trump fired all the Democrats on the FTC Board. This is also illegal. The board has to be balanced between the parties and a special procedure followed.
In good news:
--The Mayor of Newark, who Alina Habba arrested Friday, was back at the prison on Monday morning to serve the owners of the detention center with violation notices.
--The Episcopalian church, which has always stood four-square against apartheid, has announced they will NOT help wioth the settlement of the Afrikaaner "refugees."
--Senator John Thune and other Congressional leaders are pushing back against the DOGE takeover of the Library of Congress, including the appointment of Trump’s hush-money-case lawyer, Todd Blanche to be the Librarian.
Best line of the day, from glenn_storey: "Trump’s basically a walking exploding cigar."
